To set up a nightly build:

- make a user to own the build (e.g. "buildygoat")
- make a directory to hold the build (e.g. "/home/goat/nightly")
- chown the directory to the build user
- chgrp and chmod the directory as you see fit
- copy host-template.defs to host-yourhost.defs, where "yourhost" is
  the plain hostname of your system (without domain)
- edit, commit, and push host-yourhost.defs
- copy nightly-stub.sh into the bin/ subdir:
	mkdir /home/goat/nightly/bin
	cp nightly-stub.sh /home/goat/nightly/bin/nightly-stub.sh
	chown buildygoat /home/goat/nightly/bin/nightly-stub.sh
- copy nightly.sh into the bin/ subdir:
	cp nightly.sh /home/goat/nightly/bin/nightly.sh
	chown buildygoat /home/goat/nightly/bin/nightly.sh
- add to buildygoat's crontab:
	30 5 * * * cd /home/goat/nightly && bin/nightly-stub.sh
  (preferably choose the time so it's not the same as anyone else's)


The way the nightly build works:

nightly-stub.sh does nothing but invoke nightly.sh; however, if
nightly.sh discovers that it's out of date, it will exit with a
reserved error code (17); this causes nightly-stub.sh to update
nightly.sh from the tree it checked out and rerun it.

Note that nightly.sh will *not* update nightly-stub.sh; if
nightly-stub.sh needs to be updated you'll have to do it by hand.
