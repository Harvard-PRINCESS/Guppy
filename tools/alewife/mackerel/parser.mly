%token DESCRIPTION

/* An import declaration makes the definitions in a different device file
 * available in the current device definition,
 * 
 * The Mackerel compiler will search for a file with the appropriate name and
 * parse this at the same  time  as  the  main  file,  along  with  this  fileâ€™s
 * imports,  and  so  on.   Cyclic  dependencies between device files will not
 * cause errors, but the header files won't compile.
 */
%token IMPORT

/* Device ----------------------- */

/* A device declaration in Mackerel specifies a particular type of hardware device
 * (such as an ioAPIC or a particular Ethernet controller).
 */
%token DEVICE

/* Identifier for the device type, and will be used to generate identifiers
 * in the target language (typically C). The name of the name of the device must
 * correspond to the file- name of the file, including case sensitivity.
 */
%token DEVICE_NAME

/* Optionally specifies the bit order of the declarations inside the device file;
 * if specified, it must be lsbfirst (the default) or msbfirst .
 */
%} 
%token BIT_ORDER

/* the arguments that specify how to access the device.  They are treated as base
 * adresses in one of several address spaces supported by Mackerel .
 *
 * Arguments are declared in C-style type notation as either of type address (in
 * memory space) or io (in I/O space). By convention a single device argument is
 * named base .
 */

%token <string> ARG_IO ARG_TYPE ARG_ADDR

/* Address space ----------------------- */

/* Mackerel allows the specification of per-device address spaces.  This feature
 * can express  a  variety  of  hardware  features,  for  example  processor
 * model-specific  registers,  co- processor registers,  device registers that
 * must be accessed indirectly through another index registers, etc.
 */
%token SPACE

/* An identifier for the address space, and is used in register declarations
 * instead of a builtin space such as addr or io.
 */
%token SPACE_NAME
%token SPACE_SCHEME

/* An identifier for the argument giving the address for the registers. */
%token SPACE_INDEX

/* There are currently 3 built-in address spaces that Mackerel understands, and
 * addresses in these spaces require both a base and an offset.  
 */
%token SPACE_ADDR SPACE_IO SPACE_PCI
%token SPACE_ARG_BASE SPACE_ARG_OFFSET


/* Register ----------------------- */

/* A register declaration defines a particular hardware register on the device */
%token REGISTER

/* An identifier for the register. Its scope is the enclosing device
 * declaration.
 */
%token REG_NAME

/* An (optional) attribute. */
%} 
%token REG_ATTR

/* 
 * Gives the address space of this register (e.g. addr ,io ,pci ,or a
 * per-device user-defined address space).
 * 
 * As an alternative to the address space definition, and is used for registers
 * which have no address (or, alternatively, an implicit address). A good example
 * of this kind of register is a coprocessor register which requires custom
 * assembler instructions to read and write
