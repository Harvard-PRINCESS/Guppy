To install:

    $ make install

As a default, this library and the CMI files will be copied to
"/usr/local/lib/ocaml/site-lib/frontc" but you may pass a PREFIX definition to install
Frontc in another directory :

    $ make install PREFIX=my_directory

And it will be installed in "my_directory/lib/ocaml/site-lib/frontc".
