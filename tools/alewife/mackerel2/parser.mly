{%
An import declaration makes the definitions in a different device file
available in the current device definition,

The Mackerel compiler will search for a file with the appropriate name and
parse this at the same  time  as  the  main  file,  along  with  this  fileâ€™s
imports,  and  so  on.   Cyclic  dependencies between device files will not
cause errors, but the header files won't compile.

%token IMPORT

%token DEVICE

%{
Identifier for the device type, and will be used to generate identifiers
in the target language (typically C). The name of the name of the device must
correspond to the file- name of the file, including case sensitivity:
%}
%token DEVICE_NAME

{%
Optionally specifies the bit order of the declarations inside the device file;
if specified, it must be lsbfirst (the default) or msbfirst .
%} 
%token BIT_ORDER

{%
the arguments that specify how to access the device.  They are treated as
base ad- dresses in one of several address spaces supported by Mackerel 

Arguments are declared in C-style type notation as either of type address (in
memory space) or io (in I/O space). By convention a single device argument is
named base .
%}
%token ARGS
%token <string> ARG_IO ARG_TYPE ARG_ADDR

{%
a string literal in double quotes, which describes the device type being
specified, for example "AC97 Baseline Audio".
