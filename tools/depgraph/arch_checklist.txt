CHECKLIST FOR DEFINING AN ARCH

x86_64 as an example


1) [insert arch name].hs uses generic functions from
    Archdefaults.hs and Config.hs.template to determine 
    compilers, linkers, and other parts of the tool chain, 
    and finally defines a function to link a kernel, generate
    the assembly dump, and create the "stripped binary". Tools.hs
    is used by Config.hs.template to find paths to define
    the tools


2) hake.sh matches command line arguments and is the top
   level for the Hake build system. Most work is sent to Main.hs

5) tools.hs has helper functions for config.h


Ruledefs.hs - basic flounder and mackerel definitions and many
functions definitions used in Main.hs. Particulary, functions that create the meaninful parts of the makefile output. Build platform, boot image.
