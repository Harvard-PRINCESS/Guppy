# ARM FVP on Docker log

- This log is for hacking on getting the evaluation version of ARM DS-5
Development Studio to run barrelfish using Docker. To evaluate this software
you have to sign a 30-day license agreement and you sign that agreement in
literally the installation of Eclipse IDE. We'll see if we can deal with this
using literally just bash, I have no idea yet if it is feasible.

- ming put a script called install.sh at
munchmunch.seas.harvard.edu:/home/ming/Downloads/install.sh

- download this script into this directory with:

    ahp@munchmunch$ cp /home/ming/Downloads/install.sh ~/
    ahp@macos$ rsync -avz ahp@munchmunch.seas.harvard.edu:/home/ahp ./

- where did he get this script

https://developer.arm.com/products/software-development-tools/ds-5-development-studio/resources/
    - tutorials/getting-started-with-ds-5-development-studio
        - installation instructions
    - downloads
        - where to get the linux tarball

- the file bootstrap.sh now will download this file for you and put it in this
directory, I just copied the link to download the Linux 5.27.1 version into
bit.ly so it is also pinned to this version (but also please ARMDeveloper.com do
not switch out this link or CI will collapse on its face)
