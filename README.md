# Guppy

A very adaptable fish.

Any within-Guppy group organization and walkthrough material should probably go into this repo's WIKI (group organization stuff like emails on WIKI front page and walkthroughs on separate pages), wheras this README should be about the project itself.

This repository is forked from [BarrelfishOS/barrelfish](https://github.com/BarrelfishOS/barrelfish)
